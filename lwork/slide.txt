Susceptibility not indicated where same or lower than incidence.
Susceptibility to landsliding was defined as the probable 
degree of response of [the areal] rocks and soils to natural or 
artificial cutting or loading of slopes, or to anomalously high 
precipitation. High, moderate, and low susceptibility are 
delimited by the same percentages used in classifying the 
incidence of landsliding. Some generalization was necessary 
at this scale, and several small areas of high incidence and 
susceptibility were slightly exaggerated.
